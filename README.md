## Basic Tasks ##

+ Implement volume raycasting on the GPU (using fragment shaders)
      * Use front and back geometry as input‐textures for a fragment shader that does the ray traversal.
+ Update transfer function based on user input
+ Implement two different render modes:
    * iso‐surface raycasting corresponding to selected iso‐value
    * DVR (direct volume rendering) using user‐specified transfer function

## Minimum Requirements ##

+ Implement DVR (Direct Volume Rendering) in the GLSL fragment shader (35 points)
    * Opacity correction (5 points)
    * With shading (get the normals using central differences) (5 points)
    * Early ray Termination (5 points)
+ Simple interactive windowing transfer function (20 points)
+ Implement Iso-surface rendering in GLSL fragment shader (20 points)
    * With shading (get the normals using central differences) (5 points)
    * Early ray Termination (5 points)


## Bonus ##
* Axis-aligned Clipping planes (atleast two) (+5 points)
* [MIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intensity_projection) (maximum intensity projection) mode (+5 points)
* Using Pre‐integrated Transfer Function for DVR (+10 points)
* Empty‐space skipping (+15 points)

## Notes ##

* There aren't prototypes for every function you might need. Create functions as you need them.
